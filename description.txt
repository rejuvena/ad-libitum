Ad Libitum is a configuration-focused quality-of-life mod for Terraria 1.4. This is the direct successor to pbone's Utils, and will replace it once full feature parity is reached. Additional content will be added, as well.

Every feature included in Ad Libitum may be configured to your liking, including the ability to entirely disable features and items.
Items from pbone's Utils will be automatically converted, which you may toggle on/off in the config as well.
The server-side config is used for configuring features that impact other players or provide an unfair advantage over players that do not have the features toggled. The client-side config is used for personal features that let you tweak how mechanics work to your liking.

Ad Libitum adds many features - whether it be items, mechanics, NPCs, etc. - to optionally improve the player's quality of life.
Such features include, but are not limited to:
 - an item that collects and sends money directly to your piggy bank (prevents losing money on death);
 - an item that summons a portable safe, similar to the Money Trough;
 - bottomless and sponge variants of lava and honey liquids, as well as a liquid combination item;
 - magnets that further increase your item pickup range;
 - an item that directly sells picked-up items instead of sending them to your inventory;
 - configurable auto-swing tweaks, including allowing it to be constantly enabled;
 - methods to achieve endless buffs;
 - configurable increased buff slot;
 - and, of course, lots more.

This mod uses Tea Framework, which must be enabled whenever you want to use this mod.
Ad Libitum is a mod under the blanket "Rejuvena" project.
